Hi, I am a Business Informatics student (B.Sc.) currently in my 4th semester.

I am particularly interested in software development, system optimization and process automation.

Through my academic projects, I gained experience in:
- Java (Object-Oriented Programming)
- JavaFX (GUI development)
- JPA and relational databases
- 3-layer architecture
- Component-based architecture

I enjoy building structured systems and improving existing processes.

Currently improving my skills in backend development and software architecture.
